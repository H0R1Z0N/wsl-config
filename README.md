WSL Config
----------
These are my raw scripts and dotfiles used for running Arch Linux in WSL. I use i3 with [X410](http://token2shell.com/x410/).

Loosely based off Xyene's repo [here](https://github.com/Xyene/wsl-dotfiles).

Notes
=====

* You can find instructions for installing Arch in WSL [here](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL).

* The Windows scripts will launch X410 and Arch. Powershell is used so we can launch the X410 metro app. 

* File I/O in WSL is still fairly slow. If you use Zsh as your shell, I would recommend disabling the git plugin to improve latency.
